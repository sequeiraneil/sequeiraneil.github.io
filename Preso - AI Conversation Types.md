## Exploring Conversations

::: block
+ Information need is not well defined, not enough vocabulary to articulate
+ Use the AI to understand the space to get ideas for new queries
+ Like a real teacher; acquiring depth into topic

## Pinpointing Conversations
::: block

+ very clear information needs
+ Start with very specific query
+ Lot of effort from user
+ Short straight-to-the-point exchange
::: 

---

## Expanding Conversations
::: block

+ Starts with a narrow topic that becomes broader...
+ answer is unsatisfactory, OR
+ user decides they need more detail
